
behaviors to tests / tests to write:

* Make viewers lazy

* Test for correct behavior if user attempts to launch multiple runs of Randoop at once

* When launching a JUnit test from the Randoop view (by double-clicking an error),
  JUnit should be run with assertions on.

* do something sensible if randoop runs out of memory (e.g. threads=false and objectcache)

* do something sensible if randoop generates no inputs because of an equals objectcache
